BRIEF HISTORY OF A CALCULATOR

People's best friend has always been, and will always be, calculator. This powerful yet diminutive device has undergone a few significant facelifts over the millennia but their basic functions would be familiar in concept to our ancestors.
In the very beginning the abacus was introduced .It is a sort of hand operated mechanical calculator using beads on rods, first used by Sumerians and Egyptians around 2000 B C.The abacus was a table of successive columns with beads or stones representing a single unit, which could be used for addition or subtraction. Fast forward 4,500 years to 1617, when Scottish mathematician John Napier published Radiology or “calculation with rods.” In 1642, the first true “calculator” was invented: one that performed calculations through a clockwork-type of mechanism. The Pascal calculator, invented by French inventor and mathematician Blaise Pascal, was lauded for attempting arithmetic calculations previously thought impossible.
Curt Herzstark invented the first handheld, mechanical calculator in 1945 from a design he had created in 1938.In 1948 the pocket-sized calculator was invented and came in the form of the Curta calculator.The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970.In 1990 TI-81 the first graphics calculator developed for math education that added a new visual dimension to mathematics instruction. 
In the mid-2000s many of the modern smart phones were introduced and with them came a new way of calculation. Modern scientific calculators are used nowadays for all the purpose. Calculators are now in every phone, every tablet, and in every app store from 1$ to 600$.
